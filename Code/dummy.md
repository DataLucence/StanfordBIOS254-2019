DataLucence-BIOS254: Stanford 2019 course offering and material

About the data (Courtesey of Dr. Bintu):
Dynamic of Epigenetic Regulation at the Single-Cell Level (Bintu et al. 2016)
Using only the 41 data set. 
Raw images from silencing the citrine reporter with KRAB. 
KRAB silences fast, so you will need fewer frames to see changes in fluorescence.
Take a look at Settings-2013-08-01. rtf for description of the experiment.
You probably want to select images from this folder, around frame t77 when dox was added:
