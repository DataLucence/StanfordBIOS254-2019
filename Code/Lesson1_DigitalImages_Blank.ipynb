But here's what's really happening.\n",

Half way there, I notice I'm out of gas. That's OK, I have my own program for dealing with that. \"Buy gas at a station\" is a bit of instructions you didn't know I had, nor did you anticipate me using, but it's being used now anyway. I pull into the gas station, get out of my car, pay for the gas, and try to start filling up. However, the gas cover locks from the inside. I don't know about this (new car), and send you a text trying to precisely describe the error: \"Nozzle cannot pass through solid metal\".\n",

Maybe you passed a string to a function when it needed an integer.\n",

    "Higher lines tell you the context that the error happened in, i.e. what code ran before the error. Maybe you have a function that you use several times - you want to know _which_ usage of the function is giving you the error. If it's the 2nd time you use the function, then either the function _can_ work, but not in a particular context, or the function is being called in the 2nd location _before_ the first: the flow of your program is not what you expected."
